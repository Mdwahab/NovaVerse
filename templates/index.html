            <p>
                A passionate developer with a strong interest in 
                <strong>full-stack development</strong>.  
                I love turning ideas into real, functional solutions and enjoy building digital experiences 
                that are clean, modern, and meaningful.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                I completed my <strong>BE in Computer Science and Engineering (2021–2025)</strong> at 
                C.Abdul Hakeem College of Engineering & Technology with a <strong>75% score</strong>.  
                I’ve worked with technologies like <strong>Java, C, Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, 
                JavaScript</strong>, and I am always exploring new tools and frameworks.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                NovaVerse is my personal digital space — a place where I showcase my skills, projects, and 
                learning journey. Everything you see here reflects my growth as a developer, my creativity, 
                and my commitment to writing clean, quality code.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Apart from coding, I enjoy <strong>cricket, video editing, design, and music</strong>.  
                I believe learning is continuous, and every day is an opportunity to grow.
